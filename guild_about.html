						Yo yo yo, what up my peeps. Welcome to the About Us page. This is all the information you need to know about Horizons. We are a guild in Black Desert Online (BDO for short). We currently have 3 members. Looking for more? Not really sure. But check with one of the members to see if it’s recruiting season.

					<div class = "section_content">
						Let me tell u the history of Horizons. The original Horizons guild came from Maplestory. Then the name was stolen by us and we’ve stuck with it ever since. Heh. We’ve got the Horizons guild in other games as well such as Vindictus. 

						Currently, our guild in BDO consists of 3 peeps. It’s sad. Really sad, actually. Because none of our friends really want to join us. Insert cry emoji here. Our guild leader in Vindictus refuses to join us. Says that if we can convince her bf to play, then she will consider it. But she’s terrible because she still might not play. Cry more. You will get to know more about our members in the next part.

						The awesome guild members as they rank in awesomeness:
					<br>
					Misoka - Super dedicated, amazing person in game. Super dedicated, amazing person IRL. You’ll never find someone as nice, in game or IRL. Is nocturnal.  Might be vampire. Does not see sunlight… ever.
					<br>
					Gloomcake - Don’t be fooled by the ign. Gloomcake isn’t actually gloomy, just really likes cake… Eats a lot. Probably gloomy due to being too full and unable to eat more.. Yeah..
					<br>
					Scahacht - Pain in the ass ign to type out. Pain in the ass person in general. More girly than all the girls you know IRL.
					<br> 
					Hopefully more people………. Insert cry emoji here

						O there’s this thing called a Guild Taxi. Ya see. You get to take peeps on rides. On your horse, I should add. Goes zoom zoom. Kind of cool?

						But there’s also this guild taxi IRL. Gloomcake picks erryone up and we go out to eat. Don’t pay Gloomcake for the ride or gas tho. Not really our problem. Designated taxi driver.
